'''
Return a tuple:
 - Average number of influenza vacc for those who received breastmilk
 - Average number of influenza vacc for those who did NOT received breastmilk
 
 Return --> (yes, no)
 
    (total number of influenza vacc) / (total number of babies with breaskmilk)
    (total number of influenza vacc) / (total number of babies without breaskmilk)

    1 indicates "Yes"
    2 indicates "No"
    77 indicates "Donâ€™t know"
    99 could be used to represent "Missing" (assuming from the context)
    NaN represents missing data
