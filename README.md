# Data Science Specialization - University of Michigan

This repository contains assignments completed as part of the Data Science specialization offered by the **University of Michigan**.

### Description:

For this assignment, you'll be working with 2017 data on immunizations from the CDC. The data file is located in `assets/NISPUF17.csv`, and a data users guide for mapping variables in the data to the questions being asked is available at `assets/NIS-PUF17-DUG.pdf`.

#### Question 1:

Write a function called `proportion_of_education` to return the proportion of children in the dataset who had a mother with the following education levels: less than high school (<12), high school (12), more than high school but not a college graduate (>12), and college degree. The function should return a dictionary.

#### Question 2:

Explore the relationship between being fed breastmilk as a child and getting a seasonal influenza vaccine from a healthcare provider. Return a tuple of the average number of influenza vaccines for those children who received breastmilk as a child and those who did not.

#### Question 3:

Investigate if there is any evidence of a link between vaccine effectiveness and the sex of the child. Calculate the ratio of the number of children who contracted chickenpox but were vaccinated against it versus those who were vaccinated but did not contract chickenpox. Return results by sex.

#### Question 4:

Determine if there is a correlation between having had chickenpox and the number of chickenpox vaccine doses given (varicella). The function `corr_chickenpox` should return the correlation coefficient.
